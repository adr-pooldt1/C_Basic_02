/*Variables defined outside a function are [â€¦] called global variables.

Variables defined within a function are local variables.

A local variable is a variable which is either a variable declared within the function or is an argument passed to a function.

A global variable (DEF) is a variable which is accessible in multiple scopes.  It is important to note that global variables are only accessible after they have been declared.*/
